## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See all testimonials in a horizontal slider
- Receive an error message when the newsletter sign up `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### Continued development

Add a full-screen gradient background when the navigation menu is displayed.

### Useful resources

- [CSS COLOR FILTER GENERATOR](https://css-color-filter-generator.netlify.app/) - This tool gives me the CSS filter property and value which I can use to change the `img` color with a svg `src`. I use it on the social media icons in the footer.
